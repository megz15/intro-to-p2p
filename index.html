					<h3>What is P2P?</h3>
					<p>
						Peer to Peer networking, or P2P, is a decentralized network architecture where each peer, or node,
						has equal privilege, and can provide and consume resources to and from other peers in the network.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is a peer?</h3>
					<p>
						Peers are the participants of the network. Each peer serves as both a client and a server,
						and can share data and resources with other peers in the network.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Diff from traditional network arch</h3>
					<p>
						In a Client-Server model, data and resources are stored on a central server which is accessed by clients.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, P2P eliminates the need for a central server and relies on direct peer connections.
						Results in increased scalability, fault tolerance and performance.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>
						When a system joins a P2P network, it needs to discover other peers in the network.
						Some common methods of peer discovery are: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>Centralized Trackers</li>
							<li>Decentralized hash Tables (DHTs)</li>
							<li>Peer exchange (PeX)</li>
							<li>Seed Nodes</li>
							<li>Broadcast / Multicast</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

					<h3>Centralized Servers/Trackers</h3>
					<p>
						Trackers are servers that keeps track of peers in the network. <br>
						<!-- When a peer joins the network, it registers itself with the tracker. <br>
						When a peer wants to find other peers, it asks the tracker for a list of peers. <br>
						When a peer wants to share a file, it registers the file with the tracker. <br>
						When a peer wants to download a file, it asks the tracker for a list of peers that have the file. <br> -->
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>DHT's</h3>
					<p>
						Decentralized data structures that store information about peers in the network.
						<br> A peer can query the DHT to find other peers and associated resources in the network.
						<br> Can efficiently handle large scale P2P networks.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Bootstrap Nodes</h3>
					<p>
						Used in blockchain based networks (BTC, ETH).
						<br> Predefined seed nodes that are known to be online and are used by new peers to join the network.
						<br> A peer can query the bootstrap node to find other peers in the network.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>PeX</h3>
					<p>
						Peer exchange is a protocol that allows peers to exchange peer lists with each other.
						Enables clients to expand their peer list obtained from a tracker or DHT by exchanging peers with other clients.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Resource Sharing and Seeding</h3>
					<p>
						Peers can share resources in the form of files, data or processing power.
						Data is shared in the form of small chunks.
						Each chunk is identified and verified by a cryptographic hash. This is to ensure data integrity.
						When a peer wants to download a file, it queries the network for peers that have the file.
						If the piece is found to be corrupted, the peer can request the piece from another peer.
						Once a peer has the file, it can continue sharing the file with other peers in the network.
						This is good moral practice and is central to P2P networks. It's called seeding.
