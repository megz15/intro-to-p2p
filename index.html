					<h3>What is P2P?</h3>
					<p>
						Peer to Peer networking is a decentralized network architecture where each peer can provide and consume resources to and from other peers in the network, without the need for a central server.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Peer? Why I hardly know 'er!</h4>
					<p>
						Peers are the members of the network, they serve as both a client and a server, and can share data and resources with other peers in the network.
					</p>

						<h4>Difference from traditional network architectures</h4>
						<p>
							In a Client-Server model, data and resources are stored on a central server which is accessed by clients.
						</p>
						<p>
							P2P eliminates the need for a central server and relies on direct peer connections.
						</p>

						</div>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Decentralized:</b> No single point of failure</li>
							<li><b>Scalable:</b> New peers add to data or resource pool</li>
							<li><b>Fault Tolerant</b>: Redundancy via multiple peers</li>
							<li><b>High Performance:</b> Reduced congestion and load</li>
							<li><b>Low Cost:</b> Expensive server infra not needed</li>
							<li><b>Privacy:</b> Traffic routed through multiple nodes</li>
							<li><b>Community:</b> Foster collaboration and engagement</li>
						</ul>

							<h3>Cons</h3><img src="assets/cons.png" width="10%" />
						</div>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Security:</b> Malicious peers, botnets, limited control</li>
							<li><b>Legality:</b> Illegal sharing of copyrighted materials</li>
							<li><b>Latency:</b> Peers/routing can be slow</li>
							<li><b>General QoS:</b> File availability, bandwidth</li>
							<li><b>Complexity:</b> Harder to setup and maintain</li>

						<h3>How does it work?</h3>
						<p>
							When a system joins a P2P network, it needs to discover other peers in the network.<br>
							Some common methods of peer discovery are: <br>
							<ul>
								<li>Centralized Trackers</li>
								<li>Decentralized hash Tables (DHTs)</li>
								<li>Peer exchange (PeX)</li>
								<li>Seed Nodes</li>
								<li>Broadcast / Multicast</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Centralized Servers/Trackers</h3>
						<p>
							Trackers are servers that keeps track of peers in the network. <br>
							<!-- When a peer joins the network, it registers itself with the tracker. <br>
							When a peer wants to find other peers, it asks the tracker for a list of peers. <br>
							When a peer wants to share a file, it registers the file with the tracker. <br>
							When a peer wants to download a file, it asks the tracker for a list of peers that have the file. <br> -->
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>DHT's</h3>
						<p>
							Decentralized data structures that store information about peers in the network.
						</p><p>
							A peer can query the DHT to find other peers and associated resources in the network.
						</p><p>
							Can efficiently handle large scale P2P networks.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Bootstrap Nodes</h3>
						<p>
							Used in blockchain based networks (BTC, ETH).
						</p><p>
							Predefined seed nodes that are known to be online and are used by new peers to join the network.
						</p><p>
							A peer can query the bootstrap node to find other peers in the network.
						</p>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						<h3>PeX</h3>
						<p>
							Peer exchange allows peers to exchange peer lists with each other.
						</p><p>
							Enables clients to expand their peer list obtained from a tracker or DHT by exchanging peers with other clients.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Resource Sharing</h3>
						<p>
							Peers can share resources in the form of file chunks, data or processing power.
						</p><p>
							Each chunk is identified and verified by a cryptographic hash to ensure data integrity.
						<!-- </p><p>
							When a peer wants to download a file, it queries the network for peers that have the file. -->
							<!-- If the piece is found to be corrupted, the peer can request the piece from another peer. -->
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Seeding</h3>
						<p>
							Once a peer has the file, it can continue to share (seed) the file with other peers in the network.
							This is good moral practice and is central to P2P networks.

						<h3>P2P based technologies</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Direct Connect (DC++)</li>
							<li>Napster, Soulseek</li>
							<li>Torrents</li>
							<li>IPFS</li>
							<li>Briar / Jami</li>
							<li>Perfect Dark</li>
							<li>I2P</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Direct Connect</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/dc.png" />
						<p>DC is a file sharing protocol. Clients connect to a servers called "hubs" using software like EiskaltDC++ and are able to search for and directly download files from other clients.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Napster</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/napster.png" />
						<p>Napster was a P2P application used for sharing sharing digital music.</p>
						<p>Lawsuits were filed against it regarding copyright infringement.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>IPFS</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/ipfs.png" />
						<p>Inter-Planatary File System is a P2P network for storing and sharing data.</p>
						<p>IPFS uses content-addressing, ie, storing and fetching data based on the fingerprint of the actual content rather than name or location.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Torrent Protocol</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/qb.png" width="100px"/>
						<p>BitTorrent protocol is used for distributing data over the internet using torrent clients.</p>
						<p>Seeders are clients who have downloaded chunks and are actively sharing files for other clients, the peers, to download.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Briar</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/briar.png" width="100px"/>
						<p>Encrypted messaging service built on P2P, ie, it doesn't have a server for storing messages.</p>
						<p>Apart from Internet (Tor network) it can use BT, WiFI, physical memory to transfer messages.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Perfect Dark</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/perfectdark.png"/>
						<p>Japanese P2P anonymous file-sharing application based on the DKT+DHT+DU protocol.</p>
						<p>It utilizes a proprietary distributed data store network called Unity.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Invisible Internet Project (I2P)</h3>
						<img src="assets/logos/i2p.png"/>
						<p>Privacy focused anonymous overlay network for secure, private communication without censorship.</p>
						<p>Created as an alternative to traditional, open Internet.</p>
