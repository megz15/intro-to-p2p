					<h3>What is P2P?</h3>
					<p>
						Peer to Peer networking, or P2P, is a decentralized network architecture where each peer, or node,
						has equal privilege, and can provide and consume resources to and from other peers in the network.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is a peer?</h3>
					<p>
						Peers are the participants of the network. Each peer serves as both a client and a server,
						and can share data and resources with other peers in the network.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Diff from traditional network arch</h3>
					<p>
						In a Client-Server model, data and resources are stored on a central server which is accessed by clients.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, P2P eliminates the need for a central server and relies on direct peer connections.
